Advantages :

MongoDB != RDBMS

Simplicity 
MongoDB being a non-sql database management system is much simpler and complexities that come with relational databases are removed in MongoDB. JSON like, document oriented storage simplifies database systems.

Data Replication and Reliability
MongoDB allow users to replicate data on multiple mirrored servers which ensures data reliability. In case a server crashes, its mirror is still available and database processing remains unaltered. 

NoSQL Queries
MongoDB has non-sql query mechanism which results in lightning fast data storage and retrieval functionalities. JSON Based document oriented queries are extremely fast as compared to traditional sql queries.
e.g.
// your application code
class Test { int x; string [] tags;}
// mongo document for Test
{ x: 1, tags: [‘abc’,’xyz’] }

Open Source
MongoDB is a database server that is open source and customizable according to the requirements of the organization.


MongoDB is highly recommended in scenarios where fast processing and simplicity is the key. Due to its NoSQL based query mechanism it is robust, scalable and highly efficient.
